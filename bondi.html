<h2 style="color: rgba(18, 37, 16, 0.89)  ;"> <u>INGREDIENTS</h2></u>
<ul style="list-style-type: square ;">
<li>1 cup uncooked rice</li>
<li>2 cups sugar</li>
<li>5 tsp. rosewater</li>
<li>3 inch piece of cinnamon</li>
<li>5 cardamom pods</li>
<li>½ cup thick coconut milk</li>
<li>4 cups water</li>
<li>6 inch piece of raanbaa</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: rgba(18, 37, 16, 0.89)  ;"> <u>INSTRUCTIONS</h2></u>
<ol>
    <li>Wash the rice. Do it until the water runs clear.</li>
    <li>Add the rice, water, raanbaa, cinnamon and cardamom to a pot, and cook until the rice softens a bit. Make sure not to cook it all the way because we still have to cook it with sugar and coconut milk. So perhaps the aim should be to make the rice lose it’s raw and hard look. Also, you can keep the heat on medium throughout the cooking for this one.</li>
    <li>Add the sugar and while stirring, cook until the mixture thickens and becomes sticky. Before you do this, you can of course remove the raanbaa, cinnamon and cardamom if you want to. We just left them in there. It’s going to take a little bit of time for it to become thick and sticky, but you’ll need to stick around the stove to stir it from time to time, especially a bit towards the end when you’ll have to stir it almost continuously.</li>
    <li>Add the coconut milk, combine it well, and let it cook for a couple of more minutes so that the rice can soak up the coconut creaminess. You’ll have to keep stirring here.</li>
    <li>Add the rosewater, combine again and switch off the stove. Here’s something to remember; the Bondibai is going to lose moisture when you take it off the heat, so don’t overcook it, let it look glossy and moist.</li>
